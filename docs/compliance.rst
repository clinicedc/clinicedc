Compliance
==========

The framework emulates Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (based on ``ICH`` guidelines) by tracking the user name,
date/time, system version and device for each data record created or modified and storing a
snapshot of the full data record prior to each modification in a separate audit trail. The snapshot also include the Clinic EDC project release version.
