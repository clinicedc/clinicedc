Overview
========

Clinic EDC makes it easy to provide realtime rule-based data collection, query management, reporting and monitoring.

Typical workflow
----------------
A Clinic EDC collection workflow might go like this. Potential participants are screened for eligibility on the Clinic EDC project in realtime. Eligible and consenting
participants are registered on the system, allocated a unique study identifier by the system, and connected to
adaptive pre-defined follow-up and data collection schedules. Trial data is collected and
entered against the unique study identifier at point-of-care into electronic case record forms
(CRFs). Each electronic CRF has embedded skip logic and inter- and intra-form validation checks
that give immediate feedback, by way of messages on the CRF data collection screen, to the ressearch staff to resolve inconsistencies in realtime.
