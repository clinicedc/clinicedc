History
=======

Clinic EDC is a data management framework built on Django for multisite randomized longitudinal clinical trials.

`Here are a set of python modules that extend Django <https://github.com/clinicedc/edc>`__ to empower you to build an EDC / eSource system to handle data
collection and management for multi-site longitudinal clinical trials.

The codebase continues to evolve over many years of conducting clinical trials for mostly NIH-funded clinical trials through
the `Harvard T Chan School of Public Health <https://aids.harvard.edu>`__, the
`Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership <https://aids.harvard.edu/research/bhp>`__
in Gaborone, Botswana and the `London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine <https://lshtm.ac.uk>`__.
Almost all trials were originally related to HIV/AIDS research.

More recent work with the `RESPOND Africa Group <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global-health/respond-africa>`__ formerly at the
`Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine <https://lstm.ac.uk>`__ and now with the `University College London Institute for Global Health <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global-health/>`__ has expanded into Diabetes (DM),
Hypertension (HTN) and models of integrating care in Africa (https://inteafrica.org) for the
three main chronic conditions -- HIV/DM/HTN.

The implementations we develop with this framework are mostly eSource systems rather than the traditional EDCs.
