Allocation to subjects / patients
=================================

The next step is to allocate physical stock to your patients as per the Stock request. In our example, we will be allocating the 48 bottles in the request we just prepared.

When you allocate stock to patients, you are linking an unallocated bottle with a subject listed on the request.


To allocate stock to patients go back to ``Manage requests`` on the main menu:

Of the 48 bottles in the request some are Active IMP and some Placebo. Choose either Active or Placebo to start. Letâ€™s start with Placebo. Select Placebo and click submit.

The labels print in alphabetical order by stock code. Carefully affix the labels to the matching bottles covering the blank part of the stock vertical barcode label with the patient barcode label. When affixed it should look like this:
