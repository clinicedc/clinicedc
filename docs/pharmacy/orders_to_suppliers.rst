Orders (from supplier to central)
=================================

To order new IMP, complete the ``Order`` document. This document will consist of the ``Order`` document and its corresponding ``Order items``. Most orders to the supplier list one item for Active IMP and a second item for Placebo. The ``Order item`` (e.g. Active IMP) records the assignment (Active/Placebo), batch/lot number, date of manufacture, process until date, expiry date and other details. The batch number, assignment and the expiry date are the most important values as you move forward in the processing steps.
